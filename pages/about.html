        <h1>About Page</h1>
        <p>This is where I put my expertise and a little of my history.</p>
        <p>I can talk a little about using both coding and AI for the best results, not overtly relying on 
        AI but not speeding up the coding process.</p>
        <p>I can also mention my history in bioinformatics and genetics, emphasizing how important
            this kind of work has become in the scientific field.</p>
