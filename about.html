    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <div class="page-divider"><span>✦</span></div>

    <h3>Who I Am</h3>
    <p>I will admit that programming was not my first field of choice. I'd always been intruiged by it,
    but the amount of time and work it seemed to demand put me off for a good while. Most of my school
    and college career was centered around the Arts and Sciences; I graduated college with a degree in 
    evolutionary biology and ecology, not computer programming. But after a few attempted jobs, I found that 
    I performed best when my brain had something to chew on. Completing a certificate in Bioinformatics only 
    confirmed to me that my interest was in the more analytical side of resarch: I was much better - and happier -
    at creating BWA pipelines than I was collecting samples in the field.
    </p>
    <p>In August of 2025, I was employed as a data analyst and AI engineer. I learned three very important things
    during that time: 
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>I still had a passion for code.</li>
        <li>I actually had the drive to learn coding languages.</li>
        <li>AI had its problems, but it could genuinely be a useful tool when used correctly.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>So here I am now, determined to grow my skillset and use it to my advantage in the scientific
    field.
    </p>

    <h3>What I Do</h3>
    <p>Describe your areas of expertise here. What languages, tools, or frameworks do you work
    with? What kinds of problems do you love solving?</p>

    <h3>Using All The Tools</h3>
    <p>There are a lot of understandable concerns about AI and its growing influence on the job market.
    I share many of these concerns myself. I'm happy to say that throughout my experience, I've found 
    AI-backed assistant coding programs to be some of the most reliable forms of AI. They may not reinvent
    the wheel, but they're very efficient at speeding up the creation and de-bugging process.
    </p>
    <p>This website was created with a combination of manual coding and suggestions taken from the Claude
    AI. No other AI has been used - I have written these paragraphs myself. I place great value on learning and 
    understanding the basics of coding, and though Claude has been a great help, I've found I still need to know 
    the fundamentals to comprehend what changes have been made and why. It's like using a calculator: you
    could just start typing random numbers in, but understanding what each function of the calculator <em>DOES</em>
    will enable you to solve more complex equations.
