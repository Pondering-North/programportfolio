    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <div class="page-divider"><span>✦</span></div>

    <h3>Who I Am</h3>
    <p>I will admit that programming was not my first field of choice. I'd always been interested in it,
    but the amount of time and work it seemed to demand put me off for a good while. Most of my school
    and college career was centered around the Arts and Sciences; I graduated college with a degree in 
    evolutionary biology and ecology, not computer programming. But after a few attempted jobs, I found that 
    I performed best when my brain had something to chew on. I was much better - and happier -
    at creating BWA pipelines than I was collecting samples in the field.
    </p>
    <p>In August of 2025, I was employed as a data analyst and AI engineer. I learned two very important things
    during that time: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>I still had a passion for code.</li>
        <li>I actually had the drive to learn coding languages.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Career Interests</h3>
    <p>My interests focus on the fields of bioinformatics, genetics, entemology, and how they overlap. I've had 
    previous experience working in these areas in various jobs. I've worked as a volunteer sorting insect samples
    and processing bee data; I've worked on an environmental stewardship project mitigating invasive plants species;
    I've done statistical analysis of gene sequences during the time I was working on my Bioinformatics Certificate; 
    and I've created a project analyzing the potential relationship between the number of apple trees and number of
    squirrels in a neighborhood.
    <p>My main focus is on the interdependencies of biostatistics and entomology. Unfortunately, this does not seem 
    to be a very large field at the moment. My hope is to help inspire more people to study insects and insect conversation
    using the tools made available by bioinformatics. We've already seen great leaps in the field of genetics because
    of these tools; why not apply them to other areas of science?
    </p>
    <p>That being said, I'm flexible with working on any project as long as it improves my coding skills in some way.
    </p>

    <h3>What I Do</h3>
    <p>I have worked with multiple coding languages in the past, and my experience has helped me adapt for each
    project's different requirements. The languages I'm most familair with include
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Python</li>
      <li>Pytorch</li>
      <li>Pandas</li>
      <li>SQL</li>
      <li>Protege</li>
      <li>HTML</li>
      <li>CSS</li>
      <li>RStudio</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Using All The Tools</h3>
    <p>There are a lot of understandable concerns about AI and its growing influence on the job market.
    I share many of these concerns myself. I'm happy to say that throughout my experience, I've found 
    AI-backed assistant coding programs to be some of the most reliable forms of AI. They may not reinvent
    the wheel, but they're very efficient at speeding up the creation and de-bugging process.
    </p>
    <p>This website was created with a combination of manual coding and suggestions taken from the Claude
    AI. No other AI has been used - I have written these paragraphs myself. I place great value on learning and 
    understanding the basics of coding, and though Claude has been a great help, I've found I still need to know 
    the fundamentals to comprehend what changes have been made and why. It's like using a calculator: you
    could just start typing random numbers in, but understanding what each function of the calculator <em>DOES</em>
    will enable you to solve more complex equations. 
    </p>
    <p>The AI programs I've had the most experience with are Antigravity, Google AI Studio, Google Gemini, and 
    Claude AI. I also have two Microsoft Azure certifications (Azure AI Engineer Associate and Azure Data Science
    Associate); I use many of Azure's tools to create and train machine learning models, plan and manage AI
    solutions, and implement said solutions. This includes extensive work with running these apps on Google 
    Cloud Run, creating Dockers, and performing jobs and services.
