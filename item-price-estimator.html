        <!--Insert an icon (HANDDRAWN) for the app.-->
        <p>The item price estimator is my first app and my first experiment with vibe-coding. The majority of it 
            was coded with the Antigravity App, though I went through the code myself to make the changes needed
            for the app to function properly. While there are understandable concerns about AI replacing peoples'
            jobs, I don't think coders will have to worry - the process of building the app was faster, but it took
            the same amount of time to debug everything! </p>
        <p>The function of the app is very simple. Using your device's camera, you take a picture of an object. 
            The app then uses <em>retrieval augmented generation</em> (RAG) to retrieve search results containing the same
            (or a similar) object; it uses those search results to estimate the price of the object based on its 
            quality. Add a funky psychedelic theme, and the result is a handy, stylish litle gadget that makes pricing your 
            items much easier!
        </p>
        <p>Whether you're organizing a garage sale, getting rid of old furniture, or just curious, the Item Estimator
            provides a simple way to help you out.
